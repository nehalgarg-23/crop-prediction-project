# Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning and Flask

## Project Overview

This project is a **Crop Recommendation System** built using **Machine Learning** and **Flask**. It predicts the best crop that can be cultivated based on various environmental factors such as:

- Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium content in the soil
- Temperature, Humidity, and pH levels
- Rainfall

The user provides input values for these factors, and the model recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation based on the data. The project leverages a **Machine Learning** model (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) and uses **Flask** as the web framework to deploy the application.

## Features

- Predicts the best crop to cultivate based on soil and environmental conditions.
- Displays a relevant image of the recommended crop.
- Provides an intuitive user interface to input the data.
- Built using Flask for easy web deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python used to build the web application.
- **Machine Learning**: Trained model using `pickle` to load the saved model.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing the user interface with a responsive and user-friendly layout.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and styling.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical data and performing matrix operations.
